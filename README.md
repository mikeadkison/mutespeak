A way for people who can't talk to have custom voice binds for mumble, teamspeak, discord, skype, etc

Works on Windows only. Generates and runs a vbs to say the saying. Cross-platform hotkeys and text to speech will take much more work.

To route audio to the voice chat program, set Windows Stereo Mix to the default recording device as seen [here](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/39532/how-to-enable-stereo-mix-in-windows-7-to-record-audio/). Select Stereo Mix as your microphone in the voice chat program. There are probably ways to use [jack](http://www.jackaudio.org/) to route audio better.
